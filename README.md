## Why was this project created?
In the financial laboratories of the University of Mons, a study has been launched to analyse the reactions of traders to the stock markets. 
To better understand which factors are most important in their choices, what is the "human" part of this equation, and many other questions. 
To improve their results, the researchers needed to create a controlled, automated data-gathering environment. 
tradesim is an independent part of this environment, to which several sensors have been added. 
To find out more, have a look at the corresponding repository here.
